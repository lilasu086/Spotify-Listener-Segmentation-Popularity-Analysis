# Spotify Listener Segmentation & Popularity Analysis
### Scope of Project
Spotify is the largest music streaming platform in the world. It has revolutionized music listening with various machine learning applications such as NLP and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, it has become a platform for new and upcoming artists to help them reach and engage with an audience. The scope of this project is to determine what makes a particular song popular on spotify? To do so we will explore the relationship between various audio features, genres, artists, and their respective track popularities to try and uncover what truly makes a popular track. More specifically, weâ€™ll be focusing on the best and the worst of the tracks on Spotify to see if there are common themes among the two.


### Motivation (Why does it matter?)
Discovering what specifically makes songs popular will aid upcoming artists in song production. Given knowledge on how to construct a popular song, they will be able to grow faster on the platform. Additionally, the Spotify marketing team can employ top-funnel strategies with this information to drive more users to the app.
